# Smartcar Coding Challenge README

## Packages Used

The code is written in Python 2.7.12 and uses non-built in packages [Flask]
(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask/0.12.2) and [requests]
(http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/).

## Running the server

Once Python 2 is on your computer, use command prompt to go into the smartcarcc
directory and run *./server.py* to start your server. You can then open up another
terminal to run curl commands. Otherwise, if you want to run the unit tests, run
*python server_test.py*.
